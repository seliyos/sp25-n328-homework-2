## Homework 2

### Weekly Recap

This week I learned about:
Built-in Node.js modules (fs, path, and readline).
Creating CLI tools using Node.js.
Publishing modules to npm.
Writing a README.md file to document the module.

### Brief description of module and steps

This module is a CLI tool that helps create a new
folder with necessary files which is optional by
selecting y/n

The module uses the following built-in Node.js modules:
fs – For creating files and directories.
path – For managing file paths dynamically.
readline – For user input interaction by command line.
